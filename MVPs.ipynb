in the data. Consider using alternative methods that better handle gaps in the data set.\\n\\n2. **Use ISO Standard for Date and Time Extraction**: Whenever you need to perform the EXTRACT function, use the ISO standard to ensure consistency and compatibility across different SQL databases.\\n\\n3. **Avoid Problematic Aliases in Google BigQuery**: Refrain from using aliases that can cause syntax errors in Google BigQuery, such as `current` and `last`. Choose more descriptive and unique aliases to avoid conflicts and enhance query readability.\\n\\n### Date Range Instructions ###\\nTo calculate previous/last date ranges use the following guidelines:\\n- A week is defined from Monday to Sunday, thus use WEEK(MONDAY) when performing DATE_TRUNC().\\n- Use the current date (CURRENT_DATE()) as the base date for all calculations.\\n- Exclude the ongoing period in your calculations. For example, if asked for the \\'last week\\',  do not include data from the current week. Apply this logic to days, weeks, months, years, and other periods.'}, {'role': 'user', 'content': 'Generate Google Big Query SQL query only and with no explanation\\n\\nQuestion:\\nWhat was the total revenue generated yesterday?\\n'}]\n",

Consider using alternative methods that better handle gaps in the data set.\\n\\n2. **Use ISO Standard for Date and Time Extraction**: Whenever you need to perform the EXTRACT function, use the ISO standard to ensure consistency and compatibility across different SQL databases.\\n\\n3. **Avoid Problematic Aliases in Google BigQuery**: Refrain from using aliases that can cause syntax errors in Google BigQuery, such as `current` and `last`. Choose more descriptive and unique aliases to avoid conflicts and enhance query readability.\\n\\n### Date Range Instructions ###\\nTo calculate previous/last date ranges use the following guidelines:\\n- A week is defined from Monday to Sunday, thus use WEEK(MONDAY) when performing DATE_TRUNC().\\n- Use the current date (CURRENT_DATE()) as the base date for all calculations.\\n- Exclude the ongoing period in your calculations. For example, if asked for the \\'last week\\',  do not include data from the current week. Apply this logic to days, weeks, months, years, and other periods.'}, {'role': 'user', 'content': 'Generate Google Big Query SQL query only and with no explanation\\n\\nQuestion:\\nHow many items were sold in the last month?\\n'}]\n",

Consider using alternative methods that better handle gaps in the data set.\\n\\n2. **Use ISO Standard for Date and Time Extraction**: Whenever you need to perform the EXTRACT function, use the ISO standard to ensure consistency and compatibility across different SQL databases.\\n\\n3. **Avoid Problematic Aliases in Google BigQuery**: Refrain from using aliases that can cause syntax errors in Google BigQuery, such as `current` and `last`. Choose more descriptive and unique aliases to avoid conflicts and enhance query readability.\\n\\n### Date Range Instructions ###\\nTo calculate previous/last date ranges use the following guidelines:\\n- A week is defined from Monday to Sunday, thus use WEEK(MONDAY) when performing DATE_TRUNC().\\n- Use the current date (CURRENT_DATE()) as the base date for all calculations.\\n- Exclude the ongoing period in your calculations. For example, if asked for the \\'last week\\',  do not include data from the current week. Apply this logic to days, weeks, months, years, and other periods.'}, {'role': 'user', 'content': 'Generate Google Big Query SQL query only and with no explanation\\n\\nQuestion:\\nCan you provide the average daily sales volume for the previous month?\\n'}]\n",

Consider using alternative methods that better handle gaps in the data set.\\n\\n2. **Use ISO Standard for Date and Time Extraction**: Whenever you need to perform the EXTRACT function, use the ISO standard to ensure consistency and compatibility across different SQL databases.\\n\\n3. **Avoid Problematic Aliases in Google BigQuery**: Refrain from using aliases that can cause syntax errors in Google BigQuery, such as `current` and `last`. Choose more descriptive and unique aliases to avoid conflicts and enhance query readability.\\n\\n### Date Range Instructions ###\\nTo calculate previous/last date ranges use the following guidelines:\\n- A week is defined from Monday to Sunday, thus use WEEK(MONDAY) when performing DATE_TRUNC().\\n- Use the current date (CURRENT_DATE()) as the base date for all calculations.\\n- Exclude the ongoing period in your calculations. For example, if asked for the \\'last week\\',  do not include data from the current week. Apply this logic to days, weeks, months, years, and other periods.'}, {'role': 'user', 'content': 'Generate Google Big Query SQL query only and with no explanation\\n\\nQuestion:\\nHow many different customers we had last week?\\n'}]\n",

Consider using alternative methods that better handle gaps in the data set.\\n\\n2. **Use ISO Standard for Date and Time Extraction**: Whenever you need to perform the EXTRACT function, use the ISO standard to ensure consistency and compatibility across different SQL databases.\\n\\n3. **Avoid Problematic Aliases in Google BigQuery**: Refrain from using aliases that can cause syntax errors in Google BigQuery, such as `current` and `last`. Choose more descriptive and unique aliases to avoid conflicts and enhance query readability.\\n\\n### Date Range Instructions ###\\nTo calculate previous/last date ranges use the following guidelines:\\n- A week is defined from Monday to Sunday, thus use WEEK(MONDAY) when performing DATE_TRUNC().\\n- Use the current date (CURRENT_DATE()) as the base date for all calculations.\\n- Exclude the ongoing period in your calculations. For example, if asked for the \\'last week\\',  do not include data from the current week. Apply this logic to days, weeks, months, years, and other periods.'}, {'role': 'user', 'content': 'Generate Google Big Query SQL query only and with no explanation\\n\\nQuestion:\\nHow many orders were processed two days ago?\\n'}]\n",

Choose more descriptive and unique aliases to avoid conflicts and enhance query readability.\\n\\n### Date Range Instructions ###\\nTo calculate previous/last date ranges use the following guidelines:\\n- A week is defined from Monday to Sunday, thus use WEEK(MONDAY) when performing DATE_TRUNC().\\n- Use the current date (CURRENT_DATE()) as the base date for all calculations.\\n- Exclude the ongoing period in your calculations. For example, if asked for the \\'last week\\',  do not include data from the current week.

in the data. Consider using alternative methods that better handle gaps in the data set.\\n\\n2. **Use ISO Standard for Date and Time Extraction**: Whenever you need to perform the EXTRACT function, use the ISO standard to ensure consistency and compatibility across different SQL databases.\\n\\n3. **Avoid Problematic Aliases in Google BigQuery**: Refrain from using aliases that can cause syntax errors in Google BigQuery, such as `current` and `last`. Choose more descriptive and unique aliases to avoid conflicts and enhance query readability.\\n\\n### Date Range Instructions ###\\nTo calculate previous/last date ranges use the following guidelines:\\n- A week is defined from Monday to Sunday, thus use WEEK(MONDAY) when performing DATE_TRUNC().\\n- Use the current date (CURRENT_DATE()) as the base date for all calculations.\\n- Exclude the ongoing period in your calculations. For example, if asked for the \\'last week\\',  do not include data from the current week. Apply this logic to days, weeks, months, years, and other periods.'}, {'role': 'user', 'content': 'Generate Google Big Query SQL query only and with no explanation\\n\\nQuestion:\\nCan you report the total number of orders placed during the last weekend?\\n'}]\n",

Consider using alternative methods that better handle gaps in the data set.\\n\\n2. **Use ISO Standard for Date and Time Extraction**: Whenever you need to perform the EXTRACT function, use the ISO standard to ensure consistency and compatibility across different SQL databases.\\n\\n3. **Avoid Problematic Aliases in Google BigQuery**: Refrain from using aliases that can cause syntax errors in Google BigQuery, such as `current` and `last`. Choose more descriptive and unique aliases to avoid conflicts and enhance query readability.\\n\\n### Date Range Instructions ###\\nTo calculate previous/last date ranges use the following guidelines:\\n- A week is defined from Monday to Sunday, thus use WEEK(MONDAY) when performing DATE_TRUNC().\\n- Use the current date (CURRENT_DATE()) as the base date for all calculations.\\n- Exclude the ongoing period in your calculations. For example, if asked for the \\'last week\\',  do not include data from the current week. Apply this logic to days, weeks, months, years, and other periods.'}, {'role': 'user', 'content': 'Generate Google Big Query SQL query only and with no explanation\\n\\nQuestion:\\nWhat was the average order value in the previous week?\\n'}]\n",

Consider using alternative methods that better handle gaps in the data set.\\n\\n2. **Use ISO Standard for Date and Time Extraction**: Whenever you need to perform the EXTRACT function, use the ISO standard to ensure consistency and compatibility across different SQL databases.\\n\\n3. **Avoid Problematic Aliases in Google BigQuery**: Refrain from using aliases that can cause syntax errors in Google BigQuery, such as `current` and `last`. Choose more descriptive and unique aliases to avoid conflicts and enhance query readability.\\n\\n### Date Range Instructions ###\\nTo calculate previous/last date ranges use the following guidelines:\\n- A week is defined from Monday to Sunday, thus use WEEK(MONDAY) when performing DATE_TRUNC().\\n- Use the current date (CURRENT_DATE()) as the base date for all calculations.\\n- Exclude the ongoing period in your calculations. For example, if asked for the \\'last week\\',  do not include data from the current week. Apply this logic to days, weeks, months, years, and other periods.'}, {'role': 'user', 'content': 'Generate Google Big Query SQL query only and with no explanation\\n\\nQuestion:\\nHow many units were sold last year?\\n'}]\n",

Consider using alternative methods that better handle gaps in the data set.\\n\\n2. **Use ISO Standard for Date and Time Extraction**: Whenever you need to perform the EXTRACT function, use the ISO standard to ensure consistency and compatibility across different SQL databases.\\n\\n3. **Avoid Problematic Aliases in Google BigQuery**: Refrain from using aliases that can cause syntax errors in Google BigQuery, such as `current` and `last`. Choose more descriptive and unique aliases to avoid conflicts and enhance query readability.\\n\\n### Date Range Instructions ###\\nTo calculate previous/last date ranges use the following guidelines:\\n- A week is defined from Monday to Sunday, thus use WEEK(MONDAY) when performing DATE_TRUNC().\\n- Use the current date (CURRENT_DATE()) as the base date for all calculations.\\n- Exclude the ongoing period in your calculations. For example, if asked for the \\'last week\\',  do not include data from the current week. Apply this logic to days, weeks, months, years, and other periods.'}, {'role': 'user', 'content': 'Generate Google Big Query SQL query only and with no explanation\\n\\nQuestion:\\nHow many orders we had last year?\\n'}]\n",

Consider using alternative methods that better handle gaps in the data set.\\n\\n2. **Use ISO Standard for Date and Time Extraction**: Whenever you need to perform the EXTRACT function, use the ISO standard to ensure consistency and compatibility across different SQL databases.\\n\\n3. **Avoid Problematic Aliases in Google BigQuery**: Refrain from using aliases that can cause syntax errors in Google BigQuery, such as `current` and `last`. Choose more descriptive and unique aliases to avoid conflicts and enhance query readability.\\n\\n### Date Range Instructions ###\\nTo calculate previous/last date ranges use the following guidelines:\\n- A week is defined from Monday to Sunday, thus use WEEK(MONDAY) when performing DATE_TRUNC().\\n- Use the current date (CURRENT_DATE()) as the base date for all calculations.\\n- Exclude the ongoing period in your calculations. For example, if asked for the \\'last week\\',  do not include data from the current week. Apply this logic to days, weeks, months, years, and other periods.'}, {'role': 'user', 'content': 'Generate Google Big Query SQL query only and with no explanation\\n\\nQuestion:\\nWhat was the average basket size for purchases made last Thursday?\\n'}]\n",

Consider using alternative methods that better handle gaps in the data set.\\n\\n2. **Use ISO Standard for Date and Time Extraction**: Whenever you need to perform the EXTRACT function, use the ISO standard to ensure consistency and compatibility across different SQL databases.\\n\\n3. **Avoid Problematic Aliases in Google BigQuery**: Refrain from using aliases that can cause syntax errors in Google BigQuery, such as `current` and `last`. Choose more descriptive and unique aliases to avoid conflicts and enhance query readability.\\n\\n### Date Range Instructions ###\\nTo calculate previous/last date ranges use the following guidelines:\\n- A week is defined from Monday to Sunday, thus use WEEK(MONDAY) when performing DATE_TRUNC().\\n- Use the current date (CURRENT_DATE()) as the base date for all calculations.\\n- Exclude the ongoing period in your calculations. For example, if asked for the \\'last week\\',  do not include data from the current week.

Consider using alternative methods that better handle gaps in the data set.\\n\\n2. **Use ISO Standard for Date and Time Extraction**: Whenever you need to perform the EXTRACT function, use the ISO standard to ensure consistency and compatibility across different SQL databases.\\n\\n3. **Avoid Problematic Aliases in Google BigQuery**: Refrain from using aliases that can cause syntax errors in Google BigQuery, such as `current` and `last`. Choose more descriptive and unique aliases to avoid conflicts and enhance query readability.\\n\\n### Date Range Instructions ###\\nTo calculate previous/last date ranges use the following guidelines:\\n- A week is defined from Monday to Sunday, thus use WEEK(MONDAY) when performing DATE_TRUNC().\\n- Use the current date (CURRENT_DATE()) as the base date for all calculations.\\n- Exclude the ongoing period in your calculations. For example, if asked for the \\'last week\\',  do not include data from the current week.

Consider using alternative methods that better handle gaps in the data set.\\n\\n2. **Use ISO Standard for Date and Time Extraction**: Whenever you need to perform the EXTRACT function, use the ISO standard to ensure consistency and compatibility across different SQL databases.\\n\\n3. **Avoid Problematic Aliases in Google BigQuery**: Refrain from using aliases that can cause syntax errors in Google BigQuery, such as `current` and `last`. Choose more descriptive and unique aliases to avoid conflicts and enhance query readability.\\n\\n### Date Range Instructions ###\\nTo calculate previous/last date ranges use the following guidelines:\\n- A week is defined from Monday to Sunday, thus use WEEK(MONDAY) when performing DATE_TRUNC().\\n- Use the current date (CURRENT_DATE()) as the base date for all calculations.\\n- Exclude the ongoing period in your calculations. For example, if asked for the \\'last week\\',  do not include data from the current week. Apply this logic to days, weeks, months, years, and other periods.'}, {'role': 'user', 'content': 'Generate Google Big Query SQL query only and with no explanation\\n\\nQuestion:\\nCan you provide the total units sold during the year?\\n'}]\n",

Consider using alternative methods that better handle gaps in the data set.\\n\\n2. **Use ISO Standard for Date and Time Extraction**: Whenever you need to perform the EXTRACT function, use the ISO standard to ensure consistency and compatibility across different SQL databases.\\n\\n3. **Avoid Problematic Aliases in Google BigQuery**: Refrain from using aliases that can cause syntax errors in Google BigQuery, such as `current` and `last`. Choose more descriptive and unique aliases to avoid conflicts and enhance query readability.\\n\\n### Date Range Instructions ###\\nTo calculate previous/last date ranges use the following guidelines:\\n- A week is defined from Monday to Sunday, thus use WEEK(MONDAY) when performing DATE_TRUNC().\\n- Use the current date (CURRENT_DATE()) as the base date for all calculations.\\n- Exclude the ongoing period in your calculations. For example, if asked for the \\'last week\\',  do not include data from the current week. Apply this logic to days, weeks, months, years, and other periods.'}, {'role': 'user', 'content': 'Generate Google Big Query SQL query only and with no explanation\\n\\nQuestion:\\nWhat was the average basket value for all orderslast week?\\n'}]\n",

Consider using alternative methods that better handle gaps in the data set.\\n\\n2. **Use ISO Standard for Date and Time Extraction**: Whenever you need to perform the EXTRACT function, use the ISO standard to ensure consistency and compatibility across different SQL databases.\\n\\n3. **Avoid Problematic Aliases in Google BigQuery**: Refrain from using aliases that can cause syntax errors in Google BigQuery, such as `current` and `last`. Choose more descriptive and unique aliases to avoid conflicts and enhance query readability.\\n\\n### Date Range Instructions ###\\nTo calculate previous/last date ranges use the following guidelines:\\n- A week is defined from Monday to Sunday, thus use WEEK(MONDAY) when performing DATE_TRUNC().\\n- Use the current date (CURRENT_DATE()) as the base date for all calculations.\\n- Exclude the ongoing period in your calculations. For example, if asked for the \\'last week\\',  do not include data from the current week. Apply this logic to days, weeks, months, years, and other periods.'}, {'role': 'user', 'content': 'Generate Google Big Query SQL query only and with no explanation\\n\\nQuestion:\\nWhat was the most popular product category sold last month?\\n'}]\n",

Consider using alternative methods that better handle gaps in the data set.\\n\\n2. **Use ISO Standard for Date and Time Extraction**: Whenever you need to perform the EXTRACT function, use the ISO standard to ensure consistency and compatibility across different SQL databases.\\n\\n3. **Avoid Problematic Aliases in Google BigQuery**: Refrain from using aliases that can cause syntax errors in Google BigQuery, such as `current` and `last`. Choose more descriptive and unique aliases to avoid conflicts and enhance query readability.\\n\\n### Date Range Instructions ###\\nTo calculate previous/last date ranges use the following guidelines:\\n- A week is defined from Monday to Sunday, thus use WEEK(MONDAY) when performing DATE_TRUNC().\\n- Use the current date (CURRENT_DATE()) as the base date for all calculations.\\n- Exclude the ongoing period in your calculations. For example, if asked for the \\'last week\\',  do not include data from the current week. Apply this logic to days, weeks, months, years, and other periods.'}, {'role': 'user', 'content': 'Generate Google Big Query SQL query only and with no explanation\\n\\nQuestion:\\nWhat is the most sold Product Type yesterday?\\n'}]\n",

Consider using alternative methods that better handle gaps in the data set.\\n\\n2. **Use ISO Standard for Date and Time Extraction**: Whenever you need to perform the EXTRACT function, use the ISO standard to ensure consistency and compatibility across different SQL databases.\\n\\n3. **Avoid Problematic Aliases in Google BigQuery**: Refrain from using aliases that can cause syntax errors in Google BigQuery, such as `current` and `last`. Choose more descriptive and unique aliases to avoid conflicts and enhance query readability.\\n\\n### Date Range Instructions ###\\nTo calculate previous/last date ranges use the following guidelines:\\n- A week is defined from Monday to Sunday, thus use WEEK(MONDAY) when performing DATE_TRUNC().\\n- Use the current date (CURRENT_DATE()) as the base date for all calculations.\\n- Exclude the ongoing period in your calculations. For example, if asked for the \\'last week\\',  do not include data from the current week. Apply this logic to days, weeks, months, years, and other periods.'}, {'role': 'user', 'content': 'Generate Google Big Query SQL query only and with no explanation\\n\\nQuestion:\\nHow many units of the most sold product marketing category last week?\\n'}]\n",

in the data. Consider using alternative methods that better handle gaps in the data set.\\n\\n2. **Use ISO Standard for Date and Time Extraction**: Whenever you need to perform the EXTRACT function, use the ISO standard to ensure consistency and compatibility across different SQL databases.\\n\\n3. **Avoid Problematic Aliases in Google BigQuery**: Refrain from using aliases that can cause syntax errors in Google BigQuery, such as `current` and `last`. Choose more descriptive and unique aliases to avoid conflicts and enhance query readability.\\n\\n### Date Range Instructions ###\\nTo calculate previous/last date ranges use the following guidelines:\\n- A week is defined from Monday to Sunday, thus use WEEK(MONDAY) when performing DATE_TRUNC().\\n- Use the current date (CURRENT_DATE()) as the base date for all calculations.\\n- Exclude the ongoing period in your calculations. For example, if asked for the \\'last week\\',  do not include data from the current week. Apply this logic to days, weeks, months, years, and other periods.'}, {'role': 'user', 'content': 'Generate Google Big Query SQL query only and with no explanation\\n\\nQuestion:\\nHow many orders did we have from the 16th of Dec 2023 to 18th Dec 2024?\\n'}]\n",

in the data. Consider using alternative methods that better handle gaps in the data set.\\n\\n2. **Use ISO Standard for Date and Time Extraction**: Whenever you need to perform the EXTRACT function, use the ISO standard to ensure consistency and compatibility across different SQL databases.\\n\\n3. **Avoid Problematic Aliases in Google BigQuery**: Refrain from using aliases that can cause syntax errors in Google BigQuery, such as `current` and `last`. Choose more descriptive and unique aliases to avoid conflicts and enhance query readability.\\n\\n### Date Range Instructions ###\\nTo calculate previous/last date ranges use the following guidelines:\\n- A week is defined from Monday to Sunday, thus use WEEK(MONDAY) when performing DATE_TRUNC().\\n- Use the current date (CURRENT_DATE()) as the base date for all calculations.\\n- Exclude the ongoing period in your calculations. For example, if asked for the \\'last week\\',  do not include data from the current week. Apply this logic to days, weeks, months, years, and other periods.'}, {'role': 'user', 'content': 'Generate Google Big Query SQL query only and with no explanation\\n\\nQuestion:\\nWhat was the month with the highest sales last year?\\n'}]\n",

Consider using alternative methods that better handle gaps in the data set.\\n\\n2. **Use ISO Standard for Date and Time Extraction**: Whenever you need to perform the EXTRACT function, use the ISO standard to ensure consistency and compatibility across different SQL databases.\\n\\n3. **Avoid Problematic Aliases in Google BigQuery**: Refrain from using aliases that can cause syntax errors in Google BigQuery, such as `current` and `last`. Choose more descriptive and unique aliases to avoid conflicts and enhance query readability.\\n\\n### Date Range Instructions ###\\nTo calculate previous/last date ranges use the following guidelines:\\n- A week is defined from Monday to Sunday, thus use WEEK(MONDAY) when performing DATE_TRUNC().\\n- Use the current date (CURRENT_DATE()) as the base date for all calculations.\\n- Exclude the ongoing period in your calculations. For example, if asked for the \\'last week\\',  do not include data from the current week. Apply this logic to days, weeks, months, years, and other periods.'}, {'role': 'user', 'content': 'Generate Google Big Query SQL query only and with no explanation\\n\\nQuestion:\\nHow did Compression Socks sales perform in the USA market in the previous month?\\n'}]\n",

Consider using alternative methods that better handle gaps in the data set.\\n\\n2. **Use ISO Standard for Date and Time Extraction**: Whenever you need to perform the EXTRACT function, use the ISO standard to ensure consistency and compatibility across different SQL databases.\\n\\n3. **Avoid Problematic Aliases in Google BigQuery**: Refrain from using aliases that can cause syntax errors in Google BigQuery, such as `current` and `last`. Choose more descriptive and unique aliases to avoid conflicts and enhance query readability.\\n\\n### Date Range Instructions ###\\nTo calculate previous/last date ranges use the following guidelines:\\n- A week is defined from Monday to Sunday, thus use WEEK(MONDAY) when performing DATE_TRUNC().\\n- Use the current date (CURRENT_DATE()) as the base date for all calculations.\\n- Exclude the ongoing period in your calculations. For example, if asked for the \\'last week\\',  do not include data from the current week. Apply this logic to days, weeks, months, years, and other periods.'}, {'role': 'user', 'content': 'Generate Google Big Query SQL query only and with no explanation\\n\\nQuestion:\\nWhat was the sales growth of Hiking Classic Socks in the European market last month?\\n'}]\n",

Consider using alternative methods that better handle gaps in the data set.\\n\\n2. **Use ISO Standard for Date and Time Extraction**: Whenever you need to perform the EXTRACT function, use the ISO standard to ensure consistency and compatibility across different SQL databases.\\n\\n3. **Avoid Problematic Aliases in Google BigQuery**: Refrain from using aliases that can cause syntax errors in Google BigQuery, such as `current` and `last`. Choose more descriptive and unique aliases to avoid conflicts and enhance query readability.\\n\\n### Date Range Instructions ###\\nTo calculate previous/last date ranges use the following guidelines:\\n- A week is defined from Monday to Sunday, thus use WEEK(MONDAY) when performing DATE_TRUNC().\\n- Use the current date (CURRENT_DATE()) as the base date for all calculations.\\n- Exclude the ongoing period in your calculations. For example, if asked for the \\'last week\\',  do not include data from the current week. Apply this logic to days, weeks, months, years, and other periods.'}, {'role': 'user', 'content': 'Generate Google Big Query SQL query only and with no explanation\\n\\nQuestion:\\nHow many units of product product pack = 1 were sold last week?\\n'}]\n",

Consider using alternative methods that better handle gaps in the data set.\\n\\n2. **Use ISO Standard for Date and Time Extraction**: Whenever you need to perform the EXTRACT function, use the ISO standard to ensure consistency and compatibility across different SQL databases.\\n\\n3. **Avoid Problematic Aliases in Google BigQuery**: Refrain from using aliases that can cause syntax errors in Google BigQuery, such as `current` and `last`. Choose more descriptive and unique aliases to avoid conflicts and enhance query readability.\\n\\n### Date Range Instructions ###\\nTo calculate previous/last date ranges use the following guidelines:\\n- A week is defined from Monday to Sunday, thus use WEEK(MONDAY) when performing DATE_TRUNC().\\n- Use the current date (CURRENT_DATE()) as the base date for all calculations.\\n- Exclude the ongoing period in your calculations. For example, if asked for the \\'last week\\',  do not include data from the current week. Apply this logic to days, weeks, months, years, and other periods.'}, {'role': 'user', 'content': \"Generate Google Big Query SQL query only and with no explanation\\n\\nQuestion:\\nWhat's the average basket value in the Canadian market last month?\\n\"}]\n",

Choose more descriptive and unique aliases to avoid conflicts and enhance query readability.\\n\\n### Date Range Instructions ###\\nTo calculate previous/last date ranges use the following guidelines:\\n- A week is defined from Monday to Sunday, thus use WEEK(MONDAY) when performing DATE_TRUNC().\\n- Use the current date (CURRENT_DATE()) as the base date for all calculations.\\n- Exclude the ongoing period in your calculations. For example, if asked for the \\'last week\\',  do not include data from the current week.

in the data. Consider using alternative methods that better handle gaps in the data set.\\n\\n2. **Use ISO Standard for Date and Time Extraction**: Whenever you need to perform the EXTRACT function, use the ISO standard to ensure consistency and compatibility across different SQL databases.\\n\\n3. **Avoid Problematic Aliases in Google BigQuery**: Refrain from using aliases that can cause syntax errors in Google BigQuery, such as `current` and `last`. Choose more descriptive and unique aliases to avoid conflicts and enhance query readability.\\n\\n### Date Range Instructions ###\\nTo calculate previous/last date ranges use the following guidelines:\\n- A week is defined from Monday to Sunday, thus use WEEK(MONDAY) when performing DATE_TRUNC().\\n- Use the current date (CURRENT_DATE()) as the base date for all calculations.\\n- Exclude the ongoing period in your calculations. For example, if asked for the \\'last week\\',  do not include data from the current week. Apply this logic to days, weeks, months, years, and other periods.'}, {'role': 'user', 'content': 'Generate Google Big Query SQL query only and with no explanation\\n\\nQuestion:\\nWhat was the revenue generated from Dress Socks and Female Underwear last month?\\n'}]\n",

Consider using alternative methods that better handle gaps in the data set.\\n\\n2. **Use ISO Standard for Date and Time Extraction**: Whenever you need to perform the EXTRACT function, use the ISO standard to ensure consistency and compatibility across different SQL databases.\\n\\n3. **Avoid Problematic Aliases in Google BigQuery**: Refrain from using aliases that can cause syntax errors in Google BigQuery, such as `current` and `last`. Choose more descriptive and unique aliases to avoid conflicts and enhance query readability.\\n\\n### Date Range Instructions ###\\nTo calculate previous/last date ranges use the following guidelines:\\n- A week is defined from Monday to Sunday, thus use WEEK(MONDAY) when performing DATE_TRUNC().\\n- Use the current date (CURRENT_DATE()) as the base date for all calculations.\\n- Exclude the ongoing period in your calculations. For example, if asked for the \\'last week\\',  do not include data from the current week. Apply this logic to days, weeks, months, years, and other periods.'}, {'role': 'user', 'content': 'Generate Google Big Query SQL query only and with no explanation\\n\\nQuestion:\\nHow many orders were placed containing Hiking Classic Socks last 2 days?\\n'}]\n",

Choose more descriptive and unique aliases to avoid conflicts and enhance query readability.\\n\\n### Date Range Instructions ###\\nTo calculate previous/last date ranges use the following guidelines:\\n- A week is defined from Monday to Sunday, thus use WEEK(MONDAY) when performing DATE_TRUNC().\\n- Use the current date (CURRENT_DATE()) as the base date for all calculations.\\n- Exclude the ongoing period in your calculations. For example, if asked for the \\'last week\\',  do not include data from the current week. Apply this logic to days, weeks, months, years, and other periods.'}, {'role': 'user', 'content': \"Generate Google Big Query SQL query only and with no explanation\\n\\nQuestion:\\nWhat was the sales of Men's Classic Trunks last month?\\n\"}]\n",

Consider using alternative methods that better handle gaps in the data set.\\n\\n2. **Use ISO Standard for Date and Time Extraction**: Whenever you need to perform the EXTRACT function, use the ISO standard to ensure consistency and compatibility across different SQL databases.\\n\\n3. **Avoid Problematic Aliases in Google BigQuery**: Refrain from using aliases that can cause syntax errors in Google BigQuery, such as `current` and `last`. Choose more descriptive and unique aliases to avoid conflicts and enhance query readability.\\n\\n### Date Range Instructions ###\\nTo calculate previous/last date ranges use the following guidelines:\\n- A week is defined from Monday to Sunday, thus use WEEK(MONDAY) when performing DATE_TRUNC().\\n- Use the current date (CURRENT_DATE()) as the base date for all calculations.\\n- Exclude the ongoing period in your calculations. For example, if asked for the \\'last week\\',  do not include data from the current week. Apply this logic to days, weeks, months, years, and other periods.'}, {'role': 'user', 'content': \"Generate Google Big Query SQL query only and with no explanation\\n\\nQuestion:\\nHow many units of Men's Merino T-Shirt were sold last year?\\n\"}]\n",

Consider using alternative methods that better handle gaps in the data set.\\n\\n2. **Use ISO Standard for Date and Time Extraction**: Whenever you need to perform the EXTRACT function, use the ISO standard to ensure consistency and compatibility across different SQL databases.\\n\\n3. **Avoid Problematic Aliases in Google BigQuery**: Refrain from using aliases that can cause syntax errors in Google BigQuery, such as `current` and `last`. Choose more descriptive and unique aliases to avoid conflicts and enhance query readability.\\n\\n### Date Range Instructions ###\\nTo calculate previous/last date ranges use the following guidelines:\\n- A week is defined from Monday to Sunday, thus use WEEK(MONDAY) when performing DATE_TRUNC().\\n- Use the current date (CURRENT_DATE()) as the base date for all calculations.\\n- Exclude the ongoing period in your calculations. For example, if asked for the \\'last week\\',  do not include data from the current week. Apply this logic to days, weeks, months, years, and other periods.'}, {'role': 'user', 'content': 'Generate Google Big Query SQL query only and with no explanation\\n\\nQuestion:\\nWhat average basket size last month?\\n'}]\n",

in the data. Consider using alternative methods that better handle gaps in the data set.\\n\\n2. **Use ISO Standard for Date and Time Extraction**: Whenever you need to perform the EXTRACT function, use the ISO standard to ensure consistency and compatibility across different SQL databases.\\n\\n3. **Avoid Problematic Aliases in Google BigQuery**: Refrain from using aliases that can cause syntax errors in Google BigQuery, such as `current` and `last`. Choose more descriptive and unique aliases to avoid conflicts and enhance query readability.\\n\\n### Date Range Instructions ###\\nTo calculate previous/last date ranges use the following guidelines:\\n- A week is defined from Monday to Sunday, thus use WEEK(MONDAY) when performing DATE_TRUNC().\\n- Use the current date (CURRENT_DATE()) as the base date for all calculations.\\n- Exclude the ongoing period in your calculations. For example, if asked for the \\'last week\\',  do not include data from the current week. Apply this logic to days, weeks, months, years, and other periods.'}, {'role': 'user', 'content': 'Generate Google Big Query SQL query only and with no explanation\\n\\nQuestion:\\nWhat was the sales of Male Underwear in Italy last 4 days?\\n'}]\n",

in the data. Consider using alternative methods that better handle gaps in the data set.\\n\\n2. **Use ISO Standard for Date and Time Extraction**: Whenever you need to perform the EXTRACT function, use the ISO standard to ensure consistency and compatibility across different SQL databases.\\n\\n3. **Avoid Problematic Aliases in Google BigQuery**: Refrain from using aliases that can cause syntax errors in Google BigQuery, such as `current` and `last`. Choose more descriptive and unique aliases to avoid conflicts and enhance query readability.\\n\\n### Date Range Instructions ###\\nTo calculate previous/last date ranges use the following guidelines:\\n- A week is defined from Monday to Sunday, thus use WEEK(MONDAY) when performing DATE_TRUNC().\\n- Use the current date (CURRENT_DATE()) as the base date for all calculations.\\n- Exclude the ongoing period in your calculations. For example, if asked for the \\'last week\\',  do not include data from the current week. Apply this logic to days, weeks, months, years, and other periods.'}, {'role': 'user', 'content': \"Generate Google Big Query SQL query only and with no explanation\\n\\nQuestion:\\nWhat's the average basket size in Poland last 5 days?\\n\"}]\n",

Consider using alternative methods that better handle gaps in the data set.\\n\\n2. **Use ISO Standard for Date and Time Extraction**: Whenever you need to perform the EXTRACT function, use the ISO standard to ensure consistency and compatibility across different SQL databases.\\n\\n3. **Avoid Problematic Aliases in Google BigQuery**: Refrain from using aliases that can cause syntax errors in Google BigQuery, such as `current` and `last`. Choose more descriptive and unique aliases to avoid conflicts and enhance query readability.\\n\\n### Date Range Instructions ###\\nTo calculate previous/last date ranges use the following guidelines:\\n- A week is defined from Monday to Sunday, thus use WEEK(MONDAY) when performing DATE_TRUNC().\\n- Use the current date (CURRENT_DATE()) as the base date for all calculations.\\n- Exclude the ongoing period in your calculations. For example, if asked for the \\'last week\\',  do not include data from the current week. Apply this logic to days, weeks, months, years, and other periods.'}, {'role': 'user', 'content': 'Generate Google Big Query SQL query only and with no explanation\\n\\nQuestion:\\nCould you give me the sales amount of Male Underwear in the Swedish market for the previous year?\\n'}]\n",

Consider using alternative methods that better handle gaps in the data set.\\n\\n2. **Use ISO Standard for Date and Time Extraction**: Whenever you need to perform the EXTRACT function, use the ISO standard to ensure consistency and compatibility across different SQL databases.\\n\\n3. **Avoid Problematic Aliases in Google BigQuery**: Refrain from using aliases that can cause syntax errors in Google BigQuery, such as `current` and `last`. Choose more descriptive and unique aliases to avoid conflicts and enhance query readability.\\n\\n### Date Range Instructions ###\\nTo calculate previous/last date ranges use the following guidelines:\\n- A week is defined from Monday to Sunday, thus use WEEK(MONDAY) when performing DATE_TRUNC().\\n- Use the current date (CURRENT_DATE()) as the base date for all calculations.\\n- Exclude the ongoing period in your calculations. For example, if asked for the \\'last week\\',  do not include data from the current week. Apply this logic to days, weeks, months, years, and other periods.'}, {'role': 'user', 'content': 'Generate Google Big Query SQL query only and with no explanation\\n\\nQuestion:\\nHow many units and gross sales in the UK market on monthly basis for this year?\\n'}]\n",

Consider using alternative methods that better handle gaps in the data set.\\n\\n2. **Use ISO Standard for Date and Time Extraction**: Whenever you need to perform the EXTRACT function, use the ISO standard to ensure consistency and compatibility across different SQL databases.\\n\\n3. **Avoid Problematic Aliases in Google BigQuery**: Refrain from using aliases that can cause syntax errors in Google BigQuery, such as `current` and `last`. Choose more descriptive and unique aliases to avoid conflicts and enhance query readability.\\n\\n### Date Range Instructions ###\\nTo calculate previous/last date ranges use the following guidelines:\\n- A week is defined from Monday to Sunday, thus use WEEK(MONDAY) when performing DATE_TRUNC().\\n- Use the current date (CURRENT_DATE()) as the base date for all calculations.\\n- Exclude the ongoing period in your calculations. For example, if asked for the \\'last week\\',  do not include data from the current week. Apply this logic to days, weeks, months, years, and other periods.'}, {'role': 'user', 'content': 'Generate Google Big Query SQL query only and with no explanation\\n\\nQuestion:\\nHow many units and gross sales in the UK market on weekly basis for this year?\\n'}]\n",

Consider using alternative methods that better handle gaps in the data set.\\n\\n2. **Use ISO Standard for Date and Time Extraction**: Whenever you need to perform the EXTRACT function, use the ISO standard to ensure consistency and compatibility across different SQL databases.\\n\\n3. **Avoid Problematic Aliases in Google BigQuery**: Refrain from using aliases that can cause syntax errors in Google BigQuery, such as `current` and `last`. Choose more descriptive and unique aliases to avoid conflicts and enhance query readability.\\n\\n### Date Range Instructions ###\\nTo calculate previous/last date ranges use the following guidelines:\\n- A week is defined from Monday to Sunday, thus use WEEK(MONDAY) when performing DATE_TRUNC().\\n- Use the current date (CURRENT_DATE()) as the base date for all calculations.\\n- Exclude the ongoing period in your calculations. For example, if asked for the \\'last week\\',  do not include data from the current week. Apply this logic to days, weeks, months, years, and other periods.'}, {'role': 'user', 'content': 'Generate Google Big Query SQL query only and with no explanation\\n\\nQuestion:\\nHow was the sales for B01DBQVR1U in the uk market last week?\\n'}]\n",

Consider using alternative methods that better handle gaps in the data set.\\n\\n2. **Use ISO Standard for Date and Time Extraction**: Whenever you need to perform the EXTRACT function, use the ISO standard to ensure consistency and compatibility across different SQL databases.\\n\\n3. **Avoid Problematic Aliases in Google BigQuery**: Refrain from using aliases that can cause syntax errors in Google BigQuery, such as `current` and `last`. Choose more descriptive and unique aliases to avoid conflicts and enhance query readability.\\n\\n### Date Range Instructions ###\\nTo calculate previous/last date ranges use the following guidelines:\\n- A week is defined from Monday to Sunday, thus use WEEK(MONDAY) when performing DATE_TRUNC().\\n- Use the current date (CURRENT_DATE()) as the base date for all calculations.\\n- Exclude the ongoing period in your calculations. For example, if asked for the \\'last week\\',  do not include data from the current week. Apply this logic to days, weeks, months, years, and other periods.'}, {'role': 'user', 'content': 'Generate Google Big Query SQL query only and with no explanation\\n\\nQuestion:\\nGive me the monthly sales for B01DKD3KRS in the japanese market last month\\n'}]\n",

in the data. Consider using alternative methods that better handle gaps in the data set.\\n\\n2. **Use ISO Standard for Date and Time Extraction**: Whenever you need to perform the EXTRACT function, use the ISO standard to ensure consistency and compatibility across different SQL databases.\\n\\n3. **Avoid Problematic Aliases in Google BigQuery**: Refrain from using aliases that can cause syntax errors in Google BigQuery, such as `current` and `last`. Choose more descriptive and unique aliases to avoid conflicts and enhance query readability.\\n\\n### Date Range Instructions ###\\nTo calculate previous/last date ranges use the following guidelines:\\n- A week is defined from Monday to Sunday, thus use WEEK(MONDAY) when performing DATE_TRUNC().\\n- Use the current date (CURRENT_DATE()) as the base date for all calculations.\\n- Exclude the ongoing period in your calculations. For example, if asked for the \\'last week\\',  do not include data from the current week. Apply this logic to days, weeks, months, years, and other periods.'}, {'role': 'user', 'content': 'Generate Google Big Query SQL query only and with no explanation\\n\\nQuestion:\\nHow was the sales of Anti-Friction Race Socks 2-pack MC (1xBlack, 1xOrange) 43-47 in the previous 4 days?\\n'}]\n",

in the data. Consider using alternative methods that better handle gaps in the data set.\\n\\n2. **Use ISO Standard for Date and Time Extraction**: Whenever you need to perform the EXTRACT function, use the ISO standard to ensure consistency and compatibility across different SQL databases.\\n\\n3. **Avoid Problematic Aliases in Google BigQuery**: Refrain from using aliases that can cause syntax errors in Google BigQuery, such as `current` and `last`. Choose more descriptive and unique aliases to avoid conflicts and enhance query readability.\\n\\n### Date Range Instructions ###\\nTo calculate previous/last date ranges use the following guidelines:\\n- A week is defined from Monday to Sunday, thus use WEEK(MONDAY) when performing DATE_TRUNC().\\n- Use the current date (CURRENT_DATE()) as the base date for all calculations.\\n- Exclude the ongoing period in your calculations. For example, if asked for the \\'last week\\',  do not include data from the current week. Apply this logic to days, weeks, months, years, and other periods.'}, {'role': 'user', 'content': 'Generate Google Big Query SQL query only and with no explanation\\n\\nQuestion:\\nHow was the sales of products in the colour Black last quarter?\\n'}]\n",

Consider using alternative methods that better handle gaps in the data set.\\n\\n2. **Use ISO Standard for Date and Time Extraction**: Whenever you need to perform the EXTRACT function, use the ISO standard to ensure consistency and compatibility across different SQL databases.\\n\\n3. **Avoid Problematic Aliases in Google BigQuery**: Refrain from using aliases that can cause syntax errors in Google BigQuery, such as `current` and `last`. Choose more descriptive and unique aliases to avoid conflicts and enhance query readability.\\n\\n### Date Range Instructions ###\\nTo calculate previous/last date ranges use the following guidelines:\\n- A week is defined from Monday to Sunday, thus use WEEK(MONDAY) when performing DATE_TRUNC().\\n- Use the current date (CURRENT_DATE()) as the base date for all calculations.\\n- Exclude the ongoing period in your calculations. For example, if asked for the \\'last week\\',  do not include data from the current week. Apply this logic to days, weeks, months, years, and other periods.'}, {'role': 'user', 'content': 'Generate Google Big Query SQL query only and with no explanation\\n\\nQuestion:\\nHow was the sales of products in the colour Black/Big Logo last month?\\n'}]\n",

Consider using alternative methods that better handle gaps in the data set.\\n\\n2. **Use ISO Standard for Date and Time Extraction**: Whenever you need to perform the EXTRACT function, use the ISO standard to ensure consistency and compatibility across different SQL databases.\\n\\n3. **Avoid Problematic Aliases in Google BigQuery**: Refrain from using aliases that can cause syntax errors in Google BigQuery, such as `current` and `last`. Choose more descriptive and unique aliases to avoid conflicts and enhance query readability.\\n\\n### Date Range Instructions ###\\nTo calculate previous/last date ranges use the following guidelines:\\n- A week is defined from Monday to Sunday, thus use WEEK(MONDAY) when performing DATE_TRUNC().\\n- Use the current date (CURRENT_DATE()) as the base date for all calculations.\\n- Exclude the ongoing period in your calculations. For example, if asked for the \\'last week\\',  do not include data from the current week. Apply this logic to days, weeks, months, years, and other periods.'}, {'role': 'user', 'content': 'Generate Google Big Query SQL query only and with no explanation\\n\\nQuestion:\\nCan you provide the YoY sales growth rate for Compression Socks in the USA market by month for the last year?\\n'}]\n",

in the data. Consider using alternative methods that better handle gaps in the data set.\\n\\n2. **Use ISO Standard for Date and Time Extraction**: Whenever you need to perform the EXTRACT function, use the ISO standard to ensure consistency and compatibility across different SQL databases.\\n\\n3. **Avoid Problematic Aliases in Google BigQuery**: Refrain from using aliases that can cause syntax errors in Google BigQuery, such as `current` and `last`. Choose more descriptive and unique aliases to avoid conflicts and enhance query readability.\\n\\n### Date Range Instructions ###\\nTo calculate previous/last date ranges use the following guidelines:\\n- A week is defined from Monday to Sunday, thus use WEEK(MONDAY) when performing DATE_TRUNC().\\n- Use the current date (CURRENT_DATE()) as the base date for all calculations.\\n- Exclude the ongoing period in your calculations. For example, if asked for the \\'last week\\',  do not include data from the current week. Apply this logic to days, weeks, months, years, and other periods.'}, {'role': 'user', 'content': 'Generate Google Big Query SQL query only and with no explanation\\n\\nQuestion:\\nWhat was the WoW units sold change for Hiking Classic Socks in the France during the last month?\\n'}]\n",

in the data. Consider using alternative methods that better handle gaps in the data set.\\n\\n2. **Use ISO Standard for Date and Time Extraction**: Whenever you need to perform the EXTRACT function, use the ISO standard to ensure consistency and compatibility across different SQL databases.\\n\\n3. **Avoid Problematic Aliases in Google BigQuery**: Refrain from using aliases that can cause syntax errors in Google BigQuery, such as `current` and `last`. Choose more descriptive and unique aliases to avoid conflicts and enhance query readability.\\n\\n### Date Range Instructions ###\\nTo calculate previous/last date ranges use the following guidelines:\\n- A week is defined from Monday to Sunday, thus use WEEK(MONDAY) when performing DATE_TRUNC().\\n- Use the current date (CURRENT_DATE()) as the base date for all calculations.\\n- Exclude the ongoing period in your calculations. For example, if asked for the \\'last week\\',  do not include data from the current week. Apply this logic to days, weeks, months, years, and other periods.'}, {'role': 'user', 'content': 'Generate Google Big Query SQL query only and with no explanation\\n\\nQuestion:\\nHow does the YoY units sold of \"product pack = 1\" compare week over week for the past month?\\n'}]\n",

Consider using alternative methods that better handle gaps in the data set.\\n\\n2. **Use ISO Standard for Date and Time Extraction**: Whenever you need to perform the EXTRACT function, use the ISO standard to ensure consistency and compatibility across different SQL databases.\\n\\n3. **Avoid Problematic Aliases in Google BigQuery**: Refrain from using aliases that can cause syntax errors in Google BigQuery, such as `current` and `last`. Choose more descriptive and unique aliases to avoid conflicts and enhance query readability.\\n\\n### Date Range Instructions ###\\nTo calculate previous/last date ranges use the following guidelines:\\n- A week is defined from Monday to Sunday, thus use WEEK(MONDAY) when performing DATE_TRUNC().\\n- Use the current date (CURRENT_DATE()) as the base date for all calculations.\\n- Exclude the ongoing period in your calculations. For example, if asked for the \\'last week\\',  do not include data from the current week. Apply this logic to days, weeks, months, years, and other periods.'}, {'role': 'user', 'content': 'Generate Google Big Query SQL query only and with no explanation\\n\\nQuestion:\\nCould you calculate the YoY sales growth for Casual Wear last quarter?\\n'}]\n",

in the data. Consider using alternative methods that better handle gaps in the data set.\\n\\n2. **Use ISO Standard for Date and Time Extraction**: Whenever you need to perform the EXTRACT function, use the ISO standard to ensure consistency and compatibility across different SQL databases.\\n\\n3. **Avoid Problematic Aliases in Google BigQuery**: Refrain from using aliases that can cause syntax errors in Google BigQuery, such as `current` and `last`. Choose more descriptive and unique aliases to avoid conflicts and enhance query readability.\\n\\n### Date Range Instructions ###\\nTo calculate previous/last date ranges use the following guidelines:\\n- A week is defined from Monday to Sunday, thus use WEEK(MONDAY) when performing DATE_TRUNC().\\n- Use the current date (CURRENT_DATE()) as the base date for all calculations.\\n- Exclude the ongoing period in your calculations. For example, if asked for the \\'last week\\',  do not include data from the current week. Apply this logic to days, weeks, months, years, and other periods.'}, {'role': 'user', 'content': \"Generate Google Big Query SQL query only and with no explanation\\n\\nQuestion:\\nWhat's the YoY change in average basket value in the Canadian market for the past year, month over month?\\n\"}]\n",

Consider using alternative methods that better handle gaps in the data set.\\n\\n2. **Use ISO Standard for Date and Time Extraction**: Whenever you need to perform the EXTRACT function, use the ISO standard to ensure consistency and compatibility across different SQL databases.\\n\\n3. **Avoid Problematic Aliases in Google BigQuery**: Refrain from using aliases that can cause syntax errors in Google BigQuery, such as `current` and `last`. Choose more descriptive and unique aliases to avoid conflicts and enhance query readability.\\n\\n### Date Range Instructions ###\\nTo calculate previous/last date ranges use the following guidelines:\\n- A week is defined from Monday to Sunday, thus use WEEK(MONDAY) when performing DATE_TRUNC().\\n- Use the current date (CURRENT_DATE()) as the base date for all calculations.\\n- Exclude the ongoing period in your calculations. For example, if asked for the \\'last week\\',  do not include data from the current week. Apply this logic to days, weeks, months, years, and other periods.'}, {'role': 'user', 'content': 'Generate Google Big Query SQL query only and with no explanation\\n\\nQuestion:\\nCan you show the WoW change in units sold for Headwear in the past month?\\n'}]\n",

in the data. Consider using alternative methods that better handle gaps in the data set.\\n\\n2. **Use ISO Standard for Date and Time Extraction**: Whenever you need to perform the EXTRACT function, use the ISO standard to ensure consistency and compatibility across different SQL databases.\\n\\n3. **Avoid Problematic Aliases in Google BigQuery**: Refrain from using aliases that can cause syntax errors in Google BigQuery, such as `current` and `last`. Choose more descriptive and unique aliases to avoid conflicts and enhance query readability.\\n\\n### Date Range Instructions ###\\nTo calculate previous/last date ranges use the following guidelines:\\n- A week is defined from Monday to Sunday, thus use WEEK(MONDAY) when performing DATE_TRUNC().\\n- Use the current date (CURRENT_DATE()) as the base date for all calculations.\\n- Exclude the ongoing period in your calculations. For example, if asked for the \\'last week\\',  do not include data from the current week. Apply this logic to days, weeks, months, years, and other periods.'}, {'role': 'user', 'content': 'Generate Google Big Query SQL query only and with no explanation\\n\\nQuestion:\\nWhat was the YoY sales growth for Dress Socks and Female Underwear for the month of February?\\n'}]\n",

Consider using alternative methods that better handle gaps in the data set.\\n\\n2. **Use ISO Standard for Date and Time Extraction**: Whenever you need to perform the EXTRACT function, use the ISO standard to ensure consistency and compatibility across different SQL databases.\\n\\n3. **Avoid Problematic Aliases in Google BigQuery**: Refrain from using aliases that can cause syntax errors in Google BigQuery, such as `current` and `last`. Choose more descriptive and unique aliases to avoid conflicts and enhance query readability.\\n\\n### Date Range Instructions ###\\nTo calculate previous/last date ranges use the following guidelines:\\n- A week is defined from Monday to Sunday, thus use WEEK(MONDAY) when performing DATE_TRUNC().\\n- Use the current date (CURRENT_DATE()) as the base date for all calculations.\\n- Exclude the ongoing period in your calculations. For example, if asked for the \\'last week\\',  do not include data from the current week. Apply this logic to days, weeks, months, years, and other periods.'}, {'role': 'user', 'content': 'Generate Google Big Query SQL query only and with no explanation\\n\\nQuestion:\\nWhat was the YoY growth in units of Hiking Classic Socks in the last month?\\n'}]\n",

Consider using alternative methods that better handle gaps in the data set.\\n\\n2. **Use ISO Standard for Date and Time Extraction**: Whenever you need to perform the EXTRACT function, use the ISO standard to ensure consistency and compatibility across different SQL databases.\\n\\n3. **Avoid Problematic Aliases in Google BigQuery**: Refrain from using aliases that can cause syntax errors in Google BigQuery, such as `current` and `last`. Choose more descriptive and unique aliases to avoid conflicts and enhance query readability.\\n\\n### Date Range Instructions ###\\nTo calculate previous/last date ranges use the following guidelines:\\n- A week is defined from Monday to Sunday, thus use WEEK(MONDAY) when performing DATE_TRUNC().\\n- Use the current date (CURRENT_DATE()) as the base date for all calculations.\\n- Exclude the ongoing period in your calculations. For example, if asked for the \\'last week\\',  do not include data from the current week. Apply this logic to days, weeks, months, years, and other periods.'}, {'role': 'user', 'content': 'Generate Google Big Query SQL query only and with no explanation\\n\\nQuestion:\\nWhat is the YoY sales growth of Male Underwear for each month last year?\\n'}]\n",

in the data. Consider using alternative methods that better handle gaps in the data set.\\n\\n2. **Use ISO Standard for Date and Time Extraction**: Whenever you need to perform the EXTRACT function, use the ISO standard to ensure consistency and compatibility across different SQL databases.\\n\\n3. **Avoid Problematic Aliases in Google BigQuery**: Refrain from using aliases that can cause syntax errors in Google BigQuery, such as `current` and `last`. Choose more descriptive and unique aliases to avoid conflicts and enhance query readability.\\n\\n### Date Range Instructions ###\\nTo calculate previous/last date ranges use the following guidelines:\\n- A week is defined from Monday to Sunday, thus use WEEK(MONDAY) when performing DATE_TRUNC().\\n- Use the current date (CURRENT_DATE()) as the base date for all calculations.\\n- Exclude the ongoing period in your calculations. For example, if asked for the \\'last week\\',  do not include data from the current week. Apply this logic to days, weeks, months, years, and other periods.'}, {'role': 'user', 'content': 'Generate Google Big Query SQL query only and with no explanation\\n\\nQuestion:\\nCould you provide the YoY and WoW analysis on the number of orders containing Hiking Classic Socks over the last quarter?\\n'}]\n",

in the data. Consider using alternative methods that better handle gaps in the data set.\\n\\n2. **Use ISO Standard for Date and Time Extraction**: Whenever you need to perform the EXTRACT function, use the ISO standard to ensure consistency and compatibility across different SQL databases.\\n\\n3. **Avoid Problematic Aliases in Google BigQuery**: Refrain from using aliases that can cause syntax errors in Google BigQuery, such as `current` and `last`. Choose more descriptive and unique aliases to avoid conflicts and enhance query readability.\\n\\n### Date Range Instructions ###\\nTo calculate previous/last date ranges use the following guidelines:\\n- A week is defined from Monday to Sunday, thus use WEEK(MONDAY) when performing DATE_TRUNC().\\n- Use the current date (CURRENT_DATE()) as the base date for all calculations.\\n- Exclude the ongoing period in your calculations. For example, if asked for the \\'last week\\',  do not include data from the current week. Apply this logic to days, weeks, months, years, and other periods.'}, {'role': 'user', 'content': 'Generate Google Big Query SQL query only and with no explanation\\n\\nQuestion:\\nHow did the units sold of Bamboo Dress Socks compare YoY in the Japanese market during the winter season last year?\\n'}]\n",

in the data. Consider using alternative methods that better handle gaps in the data set.\\n\\n2. **Use ISO Standard for Date and Time Extraction**: Whenever you need to perform the EXTRACT function, use the ISO standard to ensure consistency and compatibility across different SQL databases.\\n\\n3. **Avoid Problematic Aliases in Google BigQuery**: Refrain from using aliases that can cause syntax errors in Google BigQuery, such as `current` and `last`. Choose more descriptive and unique aliases to avoid conflicts and enhance query readability.\\n\\n### Date Range Instructions ###\\nTo calculate previous/last date ranges use the following guidelines:\\n- A week is defined from Monday to Sunday, thus use WEEK(MONDAY) when performing DATE_TRUNC().\\n- Use the current date (CURRENT_DATE()) as the base date for all calculations.\\n- Exclude the ongoing period in your calculations. For example, if asked for the \\'last week\\',  do not include data from the current week. Apply this logic to days, weeks, months, years, and other periods.'}, {'role': 'user', 'content': 'Generate Google Big Query SQL query only and with no explanation\\n\\nQuestion:\\nWhat was the WoW sales performance of Running Wear in the UK and Germany during the last three months?\\n'}]\n",

Consider using alternative methods that better handle gaps in the data set.\\n\\n2. **Use ISO Standard for Date and Time Extraction**: Whenever you need to perform the EXTRACT function, use the ISO standard to ensure consistency and compatibility across different SQL databases.\\n\\n3. **Avoid Problematic Aliases in Google BigQuery**: Refrain from using aliases that can cause syntax errors in Google BigQuery, such as `current` and `last`. Choose more descriptive and unique aliases to avoid conflicts and enhance query readability.\\n\\n### Date Range Instructions ###\\nTo calculate previous/last date ranges use the following guidelines:\\n- A week is defined from Monday to Sunday, thus use WEEK(MONDAY) when performing DATE_TRUNC().\\n- Use the current date (CURRENT_DATE()) as the base date for all calculations.\\n- Exclude the ongoing period in your calculations. For example, if asked for the \\'last week\\',  do not include data from the current week. Apply this logic to days, weeks, months, years, and other periods.'}, {'role': 'user', 'content': 'Generate Google Big Query SQL query only and with no explanation\\n\\nQuestion:\\nCan you calculate the YoY growth rate of units sold for Casual Wear in Italy and Spain for each quarter of the previous year?\\n'}]\n",

in the data. Consider using alternative methods that better handle gaps in the data set.\\n\\n2. **Use ISO Standard for Date and Time Extraction**: Whenever you need to perform the EXTRACT function, use the ISO standard to ensure consistency and compatibility across different SQL databases.\\n\\n3. **Avoid Problematic Aliases in Google BigQuery**: Refrain from using aliases that can cause syntax errors in Google BigQuery, such as `current` and `last`. Choose more descriptive and unique aliases to avoid conflicts and enhance query readability.\\n\\n### Date Range Instructions ###\\nTo calculate previous/last date ranges use the following guidelines:\\n- A week is defined from Monday to Sunday, thus use WEEK(MONDAY) when performing DATE_TRUNC().\\n- Use the current date (CURRENT_DATE()) as the base date for all calculations.\\n- Exclude the ongoing period in your calculations. For example, if asked for the \\'last week\\',  do not include data from the current week. Apply this logic to days, weeks, months, years, and other periods.'}, {'role': 'user', 'content': 'Generate Google Big Query SQL query only and with no explanation\\n\\nQuestion:\\nWhat is the YoY comparison of average units per order for Sports Socks in the Poland and Netherlands markets during the last six months?\\n'}]\n",

Consider using alternative methods that better handle gaps in the data set.\\n\\n2. **Use ISO Standard for Date and Time Extraction**: Whenever you need to perform the EXTRACT function, use the ISO standard to ensure consistency and compatibility across different SQL databases.\\n\\n3. **Avoid Problematic Aliases in Google BigQuery**: Refrain from using aliases that can cause syntax errors in Google BigQuery, such as `current` and `last`. Choose more descriptive and unique aliases to avoid conflicts and enhance query readability.\\n\\n### Date Range Instructions ###\\nTo calculate previous/last date ranges use the following guidelines:\\n- A week is defined from Monday to Sunday, thus use WEEK(MONDAY) when performing DATE_TRUNC().\\n- Use the current date (CURRENT_DATE()) as the base date for all calculations.\\n- Exclude the ongoing period in your calculations. For example, if asked for the \\'last week\\',  do not include data from the current week.

in the data. Consider using alternative methods that better handle gaps in the data set.\\n\\n2. **Use ISO Standard for Date and Time Extraction**: Whenever you need to perform the EXTRACT function, use the ISO standard to ensure consistency and compatibility across different SQL databases.\\n\\n3. **Avoid Problematic Aliases in Google BigQuery**: Refrain from using aliases that can cause syntax errors in Google BigQuery, such as `current` and `last`. Choose more descriptive and unique aliases to avoid conflicts and enhance query readability.\\n\\n### Date Range Instructions ###\\nTo calculate previous/last date ranges use the following guidelines:\\n- A week is defined from Monday to Sunday, thus use WEEK(MONDAY) when performing DATE_TRUNC().\\n- Use the current date (CURRENT_DATE()) as the base date for all calculations.\\n- Exclude the ongoing period in your calculations. For example, if asked for the \\'last week\\',  do not include data from the current week. Apply this logic to days, weeks, months, years, and other periods.'}, {'role': 'user', 'content': \"Generate Google Big Query SQL query only and with no explanation\\n\\nQuestion:\\nWhat was the WoW growth of last week's sales for Headwear in Japan?\\n\"}]\n",

Consider using alternative methods that better handle gaps in the data set.\\n\\n2. **Use ISO Standard for Date and Time Extraction**: Whenever you need to perform the EXTRACT function, use the ISO standard to ensure consistency and compatibility across different SQL databases.\\n\\n3. **Avoid Problematic Aliases in Google BigQuery**: Refrain from using aliases that can cause syntax errors in Google BigQuery, such as `current` and `last`. Choose more descriptive and unique aliases to avoid conflicts and enhance query readability.\\n\\n### Date Range Instructions ###\\nTo calculate previous/last date ranges use the following guidelines:\\n- A week is defined from Monday to Sunday, thus use WEEK(MONDAY) when performing DATE_TRUNC().\\n- Use the current date (CURRENT_DATE()) as the base date for all calculations.\\n- Exclude the ongoing period in your calculations. For example, if asked for the \\'last week\\',  do not include data from the current week. Apply this logic to days, weeks, months, years, and other periods.'}, {'role': 'user', 'content': 'Generate Google Big Query SQL query only and with no explanation\\n\\nQuestion:\\nGive me the WoW growth in sales of the week from 25th of March to 31st of March 2024 sales for Headwear in Japan\\n'}]\n",

Consider using alternative methods that better handle gaps in the data set.\\n\\n2. **Use ISO Standard for Date and Time Extraction**: Whenever you need to perform the EXTRACT function, use the ISO standard to ensure consistency and compatibility across different SQL databases.\\n\\n3. **Avoid Problematic Aliases in Google BigQuery**: Refrain from using aliases that can cause syntax errors in Google BigQuery, such as `current` and `last`. Choose more descriptive and unique aliases to avoid conflicts and enhance query readability.\\n\\n### Date Range Instructions ###\\nTo calculate previous/last date ranges use the following guidelines:\\n- A week is defined from Monday to Sunday, thus use WEEK(MONDAY) when performing DATE_TRUNC().\\n- Use the current date (CURRENT_DATE()) as the base date for all calculations.\\n- Exclude the ongoing period in your calculations. For example, if asked for the \\'last week\\',  do not include data from the current week. Apply this logic to days, weeks, months, years, and other periods.'}, {'role': 'user', 'content': 'Generate Google Big Query SQL query only and with no explanation\\n\\nQuestion:\\nHow was the MoM growth in units for the month of April 2023 for Hiking Classic Socks in the market UK\\n'}]\n",

in the data. Consider using alternative methods that better handle gaps in the data set.\\n\\n2. **Use ISO Standard for Date and Time Extraction**: Whenever you need to perform the EXTRACT function, use the ISO standard to ensure consistency and compatibility across different SQL databases.\\n\\n3. **Avoid Problematic Aliases in Google BigQuery**: Refrain from using aliases that can cause syntax errors in Google BigQuery, such as `current` and `last`. Choose more descriptive and unique aliases to avoid conflicts and enhance query readability.\\n\\n### Date Range Instructions ###\\nTo calculate previous/last date ranges use the following guidelines:\\n- A week is defined from Monday to Sunday, thus use WEEK(MONDAY) when performing DATE_TRUNC().\\n- Use the current date (CURRENT_DATE()) as the base date for all calculations.\\n- Exclude the ongoing period in your calculations. For example, if asked for the \\'last week\\',  do not include data from the current week. Apply this logic to days, weeks, months, years, and other periods.'}, {'role': 'user', 'content': 'Generate Google Big Query SQL query only and with no explanation\\n\\nQuestion:\\nWhat was the Growth in number of orders betweem Dec 2023 and September 2023?\\n'}]\n",

in the data. Consider using alternative methods that better handle gaps in the data set.\\n\\n2. **Use ISO Standard for Date and Time Extraction**: Whenever you need to perform the EXTRACT function, use the ISO standard to ensure consistency and compatibility across different SQL databases.\\n\\n3. **Avoid Problematic Aliases in Google BigQuery**: Refrain from using aliases that can cause syntax errors in Google BigQuery, such as `current` and `last`. Choose more descriptive and unique aliases to avoid conflicts and enhance query readability.\\n\\n### Date Range Instructions ###\\nTo calculate previous/last date ranges use the following guidelines:\\n- A week is defined from Monday to Sunday, thus use WEEK(MONDAY) when performing DATE_TRUNC().\\n- Use the current date (CURRENT_DATE()) as the base date for all calculations.\\n- Exclude the ongoing period in your calculations. For example, if asked for the \\'last week\\',  do not include data from the current week. Apply this logic to days, weeks, months, years, and other periods.'}, {'role': 'user', 'content': 'Generate Google Big Query SQL query only and with no explanation\\n\\nQuestion:\\nWhat was the YoY growth in number of orders of last week?\\n'}]\n",
