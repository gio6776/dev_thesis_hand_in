## Instructions for Writing Robust SQL Queries:

1. **Avoid Using the LAG Function**: The LAG function can lead to inaccurate results when there are missing values in the data. Consider using alternative methods that better handle gaps in the data set.

2. **Use ISO Standard for Date and Time Extraction**: Whenever you need to perform the EXTRACT function, use the ISO standard to ensure consistency and compatibility across different SQL databases.

3. **Avoid Problematic Aliases in Google BigQuery**: Refrain from using aliases that can cause syntax errors in Google BigQuery, such as `current` and `last`. Choose more descriptive and unique aliases to avoid conflicts and enhance query readability.

### Date Range Instructions ###
To calculate previous/last date ranges use the following guidelines:
- A week is defined from Monday to Sunday, thus use WEEK(MONDAY) when performing DATE_TRUNC().
- Use the current date (CURRENT_DATE()) as the base date for all calculations.
- Exclude the ongoing period in your calculations. For example, if asked for the 'last week',  do not include data from the current week. Apply this logic to days, weeks, months, years, and other periods.
